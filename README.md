## Objective
Create a web app that interacts with a [repository](https://arxiv.org) of freely accessible scholarly work.

### Requirements for Web App Interface
Create a web app with a page that links to 2 other pages.
* First Page: display a list of new articles containing information relevant to psychiatry, therapy, data science or machine learning.
  * Clicking an article opens a page that displays a short summary of the article's content and names of all the authors.
  * Clicking on an author opens a page that displays the author name and the titles of articles they've submitted to arXiv over the past 30 days.
* Second Page: display a list of authors and how many articles theyâ€™ve written over the last 30 days, sorted with the newest, most prolific ones first.
  * Clicking on an author should open the author page mentioned above.

### Technical Notes
* Choose either frontend or backend:
  * Option 1 (frontend): a client-side app built in the javascript framework of your choice.
  * Option 2 (backend): a server-side app that serves up static pages in Django / Python.
* You should use the [arXiv bulk data access API](https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data) to obtain the data you need.
* If 30 days of data is not available, your web app should be able to incrementally gather the data over time in order to eventually have at least 30 days of data.
*  Make dynamic requests to the arXiv API (Do not hardcode response).
